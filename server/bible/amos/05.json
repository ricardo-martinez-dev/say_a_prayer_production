I will not listen to the music of your harps. 24 But let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream!"},{"verse":"25 “Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the wilderness, people of Israel? 26 You have lifted up the shrine of your king, the pedestal of your idols, the star of your god[b]— which you made for yourselves. 27 Therefore I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,” says the Lord, whose name is God Almighty."}]
