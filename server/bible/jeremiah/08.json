[{"verse":"8 “‘At that time, declares the Lord, the bones of the kings and officials of Judah, the bones of the priests and prophets, and the bones of the people of Jerusalem will be removed from their graves. 2 They will be exposed to the sun and the moon and all the stars of the heavens, which they have loved and served and which they have followed and consulted and worshiped. They will not be gathered up or buried, but will be like dung lying on the ground. 3 Wherever I banish them, all the survivors of this evil nation will prefer death to life, declares the Lord Almighty.’"},{"header":"Sin and Punishment"},{"verse":"4 “Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord says:"},{"verse":"“‘When people fall down, do they not get up? When someone turns away, do they not return? 5 Why then have these people turned away? Why does Jerusalem always turn away?\nThey cling to deceit; they refuse to return. 6 I have listened attentively, but they do not say what is right.\nNone of them repent of their wickedness, saying, “What have I done?”\nEach pursues their own course like a horse charging into battle. 7 Even the stork in the sky knows her appointed seasons,\nand the dove, the swift and the thrush observe the time of their migration.\nBut my people do not know the requirements of the Lord."},{"verse":"8 “‘How can you say, “We are wise, for we have the law of the Lord,”\nwhen actually the lying pen of the scribes has handled it falsely? 9 The wise will be put to shame; they will be dismayed and trapped.\nSince they have rejected the word of the Lord, what kind of wisdom do they have? 10 Therefore I will give their wives to other men and their fields to new owners.\nFrom the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain;\nprophets and priests alike, all practice deceit. 11 They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious.\n“Peace, peace,” they say, when there is no peace. 12 Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct? No, they have no shame at all; they do not even know how to blush.\nSo they will fall among the fallen; they will be brought down when they are punished,\nsays the Lord."},{"verse":"13 “‘I will take away their harvest,\ndeclares the Lord. There will be no grapes on the vine.\nThere will be no figs on the tree, and their leaves will wither.\nWhat I have given them will be taken from them.[a]’”"},{"verse":"14 Why are we sitting here? Gather together!\nLet us flee to the fortified cities and perish there!\nFor the Lord our God has doomed us to perish and given us poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned against him. 15 We hoped for peace but no good has come,\nfor a time of healing but there is only terror. 16 The snorting of the enemy’s horses is heard from Dan;\nat the neighing of their stallions the whole land trembles.\nThey have come to devour the land and everything in it, the city and all who live there."},{"verse":"17 “See, I will send venomous snakes among you, vipers that cannot be charmed, and they will bite you,”\ndeclares the Lord."},{"verse":"18 You who are my Comforter[b] in sorrow, my heart is faint within me. 19 Listen to the cry of my people from a land far away:\n“Is the Lord not in Zion? Is her King no longer there?”"},{"verse":"“Why have they aroused my anger with their images, with their worthless foreign idols?”"},{"verse":"20 “The harvest is past, the summer has ended, and we are not saved.”"},{"verse":"21 Since my people are crushed, I am crushed; I mourn, and horror grips me. 22 Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there?\nWhy then is there no healing for the wound of my people?"}]
