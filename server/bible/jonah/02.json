[{"verse":"2 1 [a]From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the Lord his God. 2 He said:"},{"verse":"“In my distress I called to the Lord, and he answered me.\nFrom deep in the realm of the dead I called for help, and you listened to my cry. 3 You hurled me into the depths, into the very heart of the seas, and the currents swirled about me;\nall your waves and breakers swept over me. 4 I said, ‘I have been banished from your sight;\nyet I will look again toward your holy temple.’ 5 The engulfing waters threatened me,[b] the deep surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head. 6 To the roots of the mountains I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever.\nBut you, Lord my God, brought my life up from the pit."},{"verse":"7 “When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, Lord,\nand my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple."},{"verse":"8 “Those who cling to worthless idols turn away from God’s love for them. 9 But I, with shouts of grateful praise, will sacrifice to you.\nWhat I have vowed I will make good. I will say, ‘Salvation comes from the Lord.’”"},{"verse":"10 And the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land."}]
