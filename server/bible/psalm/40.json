[{"header":"Psalm 40[a]"},{"header":"For the director of music. Of David. A psalm."},{"verse":"1 I waited patiently for the Lord; he turned to me and heard my cry. 2 He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire;\nhe set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand. 3 He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God.\nMany will see and fear the Lord and put their trust in him."},{"verse":"4 Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord,\nwho does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods.[b] 5 Many, Lord my God, are the wonders you have done, the things you planned for us.\nNone can compare with you; were I to speak and tell of your deeds, they would be too many to declare."},{"verse":"6 Sacrifice and offering you did not desire— but my ears you have opened[c]— burnt offerings and sin offerings[d] you did not require. 7 Then I said, “Here I am, I have come— it is written about me in the scroll.[e] 8 I desire to do your will, my God; your law is within my heart.”"},{"verse":"9 I proclaim your saving acts in the great assembly; I do not seal my lips, Lord, as you know. 10 I do not hide your righteousness in my heart; I speak of your faithfulness and your saving help.\nI do not conceal your love and your faithfulness from the great assembly."},{"verse":"11 Do not withhold your mercy from me, Lord; may your love and faithfulness always protect me. 12 For troubles without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see.\nThey are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails within me. 13 Be pleased to save me, Lord; come quickly, Lord, to help me."},{"verse":"14 May all who want to take my life be put to shame and confusion;\nmay all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace. 15 May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” be appalled at their own shame. 16 But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you;\nmay those who long for your saving help always say, “The Lord is great!”"},{"verse":"17 But as for me, I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me.\nYou are my help and my deliverer; you are my God, do not delay."}]
