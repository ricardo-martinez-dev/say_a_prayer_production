[{"header":"Psalm 43[a]"},{"verse":"1 Vindicate me, my God, and plead my cause against an unfaithful nation.\nRescue me from those who are deceitful and wicked. 2 You are God my stronghold. Why have you rejected me?\nWhy must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy? 3 Send me your light and your faithful care, let them lead me;\nlet them bring me to your holy mountain, to the place where you dwell. 4 Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my joy and my delight.\nI will praise you with the lyre, O God, my God."},{"verse":"5 Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me?\nPut your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God."}]
