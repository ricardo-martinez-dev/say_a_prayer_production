[{"header":"Psalm 52[a]"},{"header":"For the director of music. A maskil[b] of David. When Doeg the Edomite had gone to Saul and told him: “David has gone to the house of Ahimelek.”"},{"verse":"1 Why do you boast of evil, you mighty hero? Why do you boast all day long, you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God? 2 You who practice deceit, your tongue plots destruction; it is like a sharpened razor. 3 You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth.[c] 4 You love every harmful word, you deceitful tongue!"},{"verse":"5 Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin: He will snatch you up and pluck you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living. 6 The righteous will see and fear; they will laugh at you, saying, 7 “Here now is the man who did not make God his stronghold\nbut trusted in his great wealth and grew strong by destroying others!”"},{"verse":"8 But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God;\nI trust in God’s unfailing love for ever and ever. 9 For what you have done I will always praise you in the presence of your faithful people.\nAnd I will hope in your name, for your name is good."}]
