[{"header":"Israel Unrepentant"},{"verse":"6 “Come, let us return to the Lord.\nHe has torn us to pieces but he will heal us;\nhe has injured us but he will bind up our wounds. 2 After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will restore us, that we may live in his presence. 3 Let us acknowledge the Lord; let us press on to acknowledge him.\nAs surely as the sun rises, he will appear;\nhe will come to us like the winter rains, like the spring rains that water the earth.”"},{"verse":"4 “What can I do with you, Ephraim? What can I do with you, Judah?\nYour love is like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears. 5 Therefore I cut you in pieces with my prophets, I killed you with the words of my mouth— then my judgments go forth like the sun.[a] 6 For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings. 7 As at Adam,[b] they have broken the covenant; they were unfaithful to me there. 8 Gilead is a city of evildoers, stained with footprints of blood. 9 As marauders lie in ambush for a victim, so do bands of priests;\nthey murder on the road to Shechem, carrying out their wicked schemes. 10 I have seen a horrible thing in Israel: There Ephraim is given to prostitution, Israel is defiled."},{"verse":"11 “Also for you, Judah, a harvest is appointed."},{"verse":"“Whenever I would restore the fortunes of my people,"}]
