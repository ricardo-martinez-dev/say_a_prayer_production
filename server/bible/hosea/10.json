[{"verse":"10 Israel was a spreading vine; he brought forth fruit for himself.\nAs his fruit increased, he built more altars;\nas his land prospered, he adorned his sacred stones. 2 Their heart is deceitful, and now they must bear their guilt.\nThe Lord will demolish their altars and destroy their sacred stones."},{"verse":"3 Then they will say, “We have no king because we did not revere the Lord.\nBut even if we had a king, what could he do for us?” 4 They make many promises, take false oaths and make agreements;\ntherefore lawsuits spring up like poisonous weeds in a plowed field. 5 The people who live in Samaria fear for the calf-idol of Beth Aven.[a]\nIts people will mourn over it, and so will its idolatrous priests,\nthose who had rejoiced over its splendor, because it is taken from them into exile. 6 It will be carried to Assyria as tribute for the great king.\nEphraim will be disgraced; Israel will be ashamed of its foreign alliances. 7 Samaria’s king will be destroyed, swept away like a twig on the surface of the waters. 8 The high places of wickedness[b] will be destroyed— it is the sin of Israel.\nThorns and thistles will grow up and cover their altars.\nThen they will say to the mountains, “Cover us!” and to the hills, “Fall on us!”"},{"verse":"9 “Since the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, Israel, and there you have remained.[c]\nWill not war again overtake the evildoers in Gibeah? 10 When I please, I will punish them; nations will be gathered against them to put them in bonds for their double sin. 11 Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh;\nso I will put a yoke on her fair neck.\nI will drive Ephraim, Judah must plow, and Jacob must break up the ground. 12 Sow righteousness for yourselves, reap the fruit of unfailing love,\nand break up your unplowed ground; for it is time to seek the Lord,\nuntil he comes and showers his righteousness on you. 13 But you have planted wickedness, you have reaped evil, you have eaten the fruit of deception.\nBecause you have depended on your own strength and on your many warriors, 14 the roar of battle will rise against your people, so that all your fortresses will be devastated—\nas Shalman devastated Beth Arbel on the day of battle, when mothers were dashed to the ground with their children. 15 So will it happen to you, Bethel, because your wickedness is great.\nWhen that day dawns, the king of Israel will be completely destroyed."}]
