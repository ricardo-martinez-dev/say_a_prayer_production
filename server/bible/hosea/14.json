[{"header":"Repentance to Bring Blessing"},{"verse":"14 [a]Return, Israel, to the Lord your God. Your sins have been your downfall! 2 Take words with you and return to the Lord.\nSay to him: “Forgive all our sins\nand receive us graciously, that we may offer the fruit of our lips.[b] 3 Assyria cannot save us; we will not mount warhorses.\nWe will never again say ‘Our gods’ to what our own hands have made, for in you the fatherless find compassion.”"},{"verse":"4 “I will heal their waywardness and love them freely, for my anger has turned away from them. 5 I will be like the dew to Israel; he will blossom like a lily.\nLike a cedar of Lebanon he will send down his roots; 6 his young shoots will grow.\nHis splendor will be like an olive tree, his fragrance like a cedar of Lebanon. 7 People will dwell again in his shade; they will flourish like the grain,\nthey will blossom like the vine— Israel’s fame will be like the wine of Lebanon. 8 Ephraim, what more have I[c] to do with idols? I will answer him and care for him.\nI am like a flourishing juniper; your fruitfulness comes from me.”"},{"verse":"9 Who is wise? Let them realize these things. Who is discerning? Let them understand.\nThe ways of the Lord are right; the righteous walk in them, but the rebellious stumble in them."}]
