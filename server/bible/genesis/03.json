She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves."},{"verse":"8 Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden. 9 But the Lord God called to the man, “Where are you?”"},{"verse":"10 He answered, “I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.”"},{"verse":"11 And he said, “Who told you that you were naked?
