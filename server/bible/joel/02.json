Who can endure it?"},{"header":"Rend Your Heart"},{"verse":"12 “Even now,” declares the Lord, “return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.”"},{"verse":"13 Rend your heart and not your garments.\nReturn to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and compassionate,\nslow to anger and abounding in love, and he relents from sending calamity. 14 Who knows? He may turn and relent and leave behind a blessing—\ngrain offerings and drink offerings for the Lord your God."},{"verse":"15 Blow the trumpet in Zion, declare a holy fast, call a sacred assembly. 16 Gather the people, consecrate the assembly;\nbring together the elders, gather the children, those nursing at the breast.\nLet the bridegroom leave his room and the bride her chamber. 17 Let the priests, who minister before the Lord, weep between the portico and the altar.\nLet them say, “Spare your people, Lord. Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn, a byword among the nations.\nWhy should they say among the peoples, ‘Where is their God?’”"},{"header":"The Lord’s Answer"},{"verse":"18 Then the Lord was jealous for his land and took pity on his people."},{"verse":"19 The Lord replied[a] to them:"},{"verse":"“I am sending you grain, new wine and olive oil, enough to satisfy you fully;\nnever again will I make you an object of scorn to the nations."},{"verse":"20 “I will drive the northern horde far from you, pushing it into a parched and barren land;\nits eastern ranks will drown in the Dead Sea and its western ranks in the Mediterranean Sea.\nAnd its stench will go up; its smell will rise.”"},{"verse":"Surely he has done great things! 21 Do not be afraid, land of Judah; be glad and rejoice.\nSurely the Lord has done great things! 22 Do not be afraid, you wild animals, for the pastures in the wilderness are becoming green.\nThe trees are bearing their fruit; the fig tree and the vine yield their riches. 23 Be glad, people of Zion, rejoice in the Lord your God,\nfor he has given you the autumn rains because he is faithful.\nHe sends you abundant showers, both autumn and spring rains, as before. 24 The threshing floors will be filled with grain; the vats will overflow with new wine and oil."},{"verse":"25 “I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten— the great locust and the young locust, the other locusts and the locust swarm[b]—\nmy great army that I sent among you. 26 You will have plenty to eat, until you are full, and you will praise the name of the Lord your God, who has worked wonders for you;\nnever again will my people be shamed. 27 Then you will know that I am in Israel, that I am the Lord your God, and that there is no other;\nnever again will my people be shamed."},{"header":"The Day of the Lord"},{"verse":"28 “And afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people.\nYour sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions. 29 Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days. 30 I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and billows of smoke. 31 The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. 32 And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved;\nfor on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be deliverance, as the Lord has said,\neven among the survivors whom the Lord calls.[c]"}]
