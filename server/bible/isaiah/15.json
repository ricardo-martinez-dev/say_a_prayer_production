[{"header":"A Prophecy Against Moab"},{"verse":"15 A prophecy against Moab:"},{"verse":"Ar in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night!\nKir in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! 2 Dibon goes up to its temple, to its high places to weep; Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba.\nEvery head is shaved and every beard cut off. 3 In the streets they wear sackcloth; on the roofs and in the public squares\nthey all wail, prostrate with weeping. 4 Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, their voices are heard all the way to Jahaz.\nTherefore the armed men of Moab cry out, and their hearts are faint."},{"verse":"5 My heart cries out over Moab; her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath Shelishiyah.\nThey go up the hill to Luhith, weeping as they go;\non the road to Horonaim they lament their destruction. 6 The waters of Nimrim are dried up and the grass is withered;\nthe vegetation is gone and nothing green is left. 7 So the wealth they have acquired and stored up they carry away over the Ravine of the Poplars. 8 Their outcry echoes along the border of Moab; their wailing reaches as far as Eglaim, their lamentation as far as Beer Elim. 9 The waters of Dimon[a] are full of blood, but I will bring still more upon Dimon[b]—\na lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon those who remain in the land."}]
