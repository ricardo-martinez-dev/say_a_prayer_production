[{"header":"Zion’s New Name"},{"verse":"62 For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent, for Jerusalem’s sake I will not remain quiet,\ntill her vindication shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch. 2 The nations will see your vindication, and all kings your glory;\nyou will be called by a new name that the mouth of the Lord will bestow. 3 You will be a crown of splendor in the Lord’s hand, a royal diadem in the hand of your God. 4 No longer will they call you Deserted, or name your land Desolate.\nBut you will be called Hephzibah,[a] and your land Beulah[b];\nfor the Lord will take delight in you, and your land will be married. 5 As a young man marries a young woman, so will your Builder marry you;\nas a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so will your God rejoice over you."},{"verse":"6 I have posted watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they will never be silent day or night.\nYou who call on the Lord, give yourselves no rest, 7 and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth."},{"verse":"8 The Lord has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm:\n“Never again will I give your grain as food for your enemies,\nand never again will foreigners drink the new wine for which you have toiled; 9 but those who harvest it will eat it and praise the Lord,\nand those who gather the grapes will drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.”"},{"verse":"10 Pass through, pass through the gates! Prepare the way for the people.\nBuild up, build up the highway! Remove the stones.\nRaise a banner for the nations."},{"verse":"11 The Lord has made proclamation to the ends of the earth:\n“Say to Daughter Zion, ‘See, your Savior comes!\nSee, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.’” 12 They will be called the Holy People, the Redeemed of the Lord;\nand you will be called Sought After, the City No Longer Deserted."}]
