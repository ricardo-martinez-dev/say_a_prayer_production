[{"verse":"10 As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. 2 The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left. 3 Even as fools walk along the road, they lack sense and show everyone how stupid they are. 4 If a ruler’s anger rises against you, do not leave your post; calmness can lay great offenses to rest."},{"verse":"5 There is an evil I have seen under the sun, the sort of error that arises from a ruler: 6 Fools are put in many high positions, while the rich occupy the low ones. 7 I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves."},{"verse":"8 Whoever digs a pit may fall into it; whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake. 9 Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them; whoever splits logs may be endangered by them."},{"verse":"10 If the ax is dull and its edge unsharpened,\nmore strength is needed, but skill will bring success."},{"verse":"11 If a snake bites before it is charmed, the charmer receives no fee."},{"verse":"12 Words from the mouth of the wise are gracious, but fools are consumed by their own lips. 13 At the beginning their words are folly; at the end they are wicked madness— 14 and fools multiply words."},{"verse":"No one knows what is coming— who can tell someone else what will happen after them?"},{"verse":"15 The toil of fools wearies them; they do not know the way to town."},{"verse":"16 Woe to the land whose king was a servant[a] and whose princes feast in the morning. 17 Blessed is the land whose king is of noble birth and whose princes eat at a proper time— for strength and not for drunkenness."},{"verse":"18 Through laziness, the rafters sag; because of idle hands, the house leaks."},{"verse":"19 A feast is made for laughter, wine makes life merry, and money is the answer for everything."},{"verse":"20 Do not revile the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich in your bedroom,\nbecause a bird in the sky may carry your words, and a bird on the wing may report what you say."}]
